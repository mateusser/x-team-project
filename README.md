# x-team-project

This project was done in 4 hours.
I focused in getting the main page done.
There were no time to add javascript, other pages, mobile design.

I used BEM to name my CSS classes.

There are a lot of assets that must be exported and it take a lot a time, my suggestion is to have an easy downlodable file to get them all in one click.
